# Brioche Cafe Website

A static site built for the cafe I do a couple of shifts in a week. A great independent cafe/coffeeshop in the alternative capital of Britain, Totnes. Built using Bootstrap to provide a mobile first responsive design, with custom CSS and Javascript providing additional design features. Will be deployed from its own Github account with a custom domain.
